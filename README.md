# iOS Developers

We're a Slack community for iOS developers. We care about three things; being open, helping each other and sharing knowledge.
If this sounds like you then feel free to [request an invite](http://ios-developers.io). We look forward to getting to know you.

### Our Three Rules

As mentioned above, we have three, simple rules that we expect all community members to follow;

#### 1. Being open

We're not interested in creating an admin-driven or hierarchial community. We run with a totally flat structure. We want our members to be apart of the community just as much as we are and as we expand we're ensuring that we do so with everyone's consent.

We also expect our members to be completely honest and open about their thoughts and opinions -- honesty drives a better community!

#### 2. Helping each other

This community was founded on helping each other. That's why we encourage our members to actively help each other where and when we can. The more we do this, the better our community will become. It's certainly not uncommon for one of us to jump on a Google Hangout to discuss and talk through programming issues.

#### 3. Sharing knowledge

They say that knowledge is power. Well, we see that sharing that knowledge is an even greater power and a power for good. We're not interested in keeping our knowledge to ourselves. We're interested in helping others and doing so by sharing what we've learnt.

## Social Networks

We're only active within the Slack community, however, we do share helpful articles, videos, etc. on Twitter. We _do_ have a Google+ page but that is solely for our monthly hangout videos.

## A work in progress

The community as a whole is a work in progress. We're constantly working at what we can do to make things better for ourselves and for others. This document is an ongoing piece that will always be updated.
